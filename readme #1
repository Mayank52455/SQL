# SQL JOINs – Quick README

This README explains **when and how to use INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN** using simple rules and examples.

---

## 1. INNER JOIN

### What it does

Returns **only rows that exist in BOTH tables**.

### When to use

* You only want records that have matching data in another table
* Missing data should be excluded

### Example

Show patients **who have at least one admission**:

```sql
SELECT p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name
FROM patients p
INNER JOIN admissions a
  ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id;
```

---

## 2. LEFT JOIN

### What it does

Returns **ALL rows from the LEFT table**, and matching rows from the right table.
If there is no match, columns from the right table are **NULL**.

### When to use

* You want to keep all rows from one main table
* You want to detect missing relationships

### Example 1: Show all patients (even those without admissions)

```sql
SELECT p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name, a.admission_date
FROM patients p
LEFT JOIN admissions a
  ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id;
```

### Example 2: Show patients with NO admissions

```sql
SELECT p.patient_id, p.first_name, p.last_name
FROM patients p
LEFT JOIN admissions a
  ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id
WHERE a.patient_id IS NULL;
```

## 3. RIGHT JOIN

### What it does

Returns **ALL rows from the RIGHT table**, and matching rows from the left table.

### When to use

* Rarely used
* Can always be rewritten as a LEFT JOIN by switching table order

### Example

Show all admissions, even if patient data is missing:

```sql
SELECT p.first_name, p.last_name, a.admission_date
FROM patients p
RIGHT JOIN admissions a
  ON p.patient_id = a.patient_id;
```

## 4. Simple Rule to Remember

> **Choose the table you never want to lose → make it the LEFT table**

---

## 5. Quick Decision Table

| Goal                            | JOIN to use |
| ------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Only matching rows              | INNER JOIN  |
| Keep all rows from main table   | LEFT JOIN   |
| Keep all rows from second table | RIGHT JOIN  |

---

## 6. Common Mistakes

* Using `INNER JOIN` when you want missing data
* Using `WHERE column IS NULL` with INNER JOIN (will return nothing)
* Forgetting JOIN conditions (`ON` clause)

---

## 7. Key Takeaway

* **INNER JOIN** → must exist in both tables
* **LEFT JOIN** → keep everything from the left
* **RIGHT JOIN** → keep everything from the right

Once you understand this, SQL becomes much easier.
